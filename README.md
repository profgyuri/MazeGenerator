You find your maze hard to solve? Well, your computer sure won't(, although it may take some time)! Select one of the 3 solving mechanisms, and see how it will get solved! You don't like the default blue path? Use the slider to solver the maze! You can give the different solving modes different colors, or just make a simple rainbow path! Just set the step delay to a reasonable amount (like 10ms for small mazes), and just pull the color slider left and right!

You can even save the maze before and after your pc solved it. Because who knows? There may be a maze, where a solution draws out the head of a cat. It would be a shame, if it got lost forever!
